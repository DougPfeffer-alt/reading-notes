__Markdown Notes!__

Markdown saves a ton of time. What, in HTML, might take 5 key strokes, would take far less time in Markdown. I can see it as an incredible tool for collaboration, and simplicity...but it does seem a little limited.

Mastering Markdown on Github covered the basics, as well as a ton of examples from very basic heading differences, down to emojis.....great resource.

Github pages gave a great overview....and introduction to Github, and basically outlined it's uses, and why it's a great tool for developers.

Github markdown syntax was another great resource (bookmark), providing a go to option for a ton of great ways to input on the site.

***Key Takeaways***

1. Easy to collaboratively edit pages
2. You can format text, and take advantage of the automation of the site
3. Having a couple of key pages to bookmark makes a lot of sense
4. Super easy
5. Good tool....will need to bookmark all additonal resources, beacuse there is a ton that you can do
