- Key concepts in positioning elements:
  - Building Blocks (In CSS, boxes will either be inline or block-level)
  - Containing blocks (One block elements sitting inside another. Known as containing or parent element)
  - Controlling the position of elements.
    - Normal Flow or Static (Each Block-level element sits on top of the next one).
    - Relative Positioning (in relation to where it would have been in normal flow).
    - Absolute Positioning (our of normal flow).
    - Fixed Positioning (fixed value).
    - Floating elements (places it to either far left or the far right).
      - Clear Float (sayijg that no element should touch the far right or far right of a box)
        - Can use:
          - Left/Right
          - Both
          - None
    - Z-Index (control the element that sits on top).
- Creating multi-column layouts with floats:
  - You can use:
    - Width
    - FLoat
    - Margin
- Screen Sizes: Different visitors will have different size screens. You will need to design pages that will work on a variety of screens.
- Screen resolution: You'll need to account for this too.
- Page Sizes: Because screen sizes and displays vary so much, most web designers create pages around 960-1000 pixels.
- Fixed Width Layouts: These do not change as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
  - The width of the main boxes will be spelled out in pixels.
- Liquid Layouts: These stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their screen.
  - We use percentages to specify the width.
    Layout Grids: Many wed designers use grid structure to position items on the page.
- Fixed Width Layout: To create, the width of the main bozes on a page will be specified in pixels.
- CSS Frameworks make life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating:
