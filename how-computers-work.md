# How Computers Work 

## What Makes a Computer, a Computer?

- A tool to help us, that contains 4 elements
    - Input
        - Instructions on what to do
    - Storage
        - Memory
    - Processing
        - Manipulating memory
    - Output
        - Final output after processing of memory is complete
- The output from one computer will become the input for another.

## How Compuers Work: Binary & Data

- 1s and 0s represent the circuit either being on or off....this is known as a Bit. More bits equal more capacity for info.
- Decimal (0-9) / Binary (1 and 0) 
    - Decimal system counts by 10s and Binary system counts by 2s. 
    - This means that the number 9 is resented as 1001.
        - 1 X 8 (8 because we've multiplied 2 X 4 positions)
        - 0 X 0 
        - 0 X 0
        - 1 X 1 
        - Equals 9
    - In the end, 1s and 0s can represent all numbers.
    Text, Images and Graphics can all be represent in binary.
        - Letters as a number relevant to their position in the alphabet.
        - Images with colors represented.
        - Sound too.....based on the bits.
    - When making an app, we need to understand that binary is the backbone of the computer.

    ## Circuits & Logic

    - Every in input and output can be represented as either on or off, and this needs circuits.
    - Electronic components come together to form circuits.
    - Smaller circuits mean faster speed.

    ## CPU, Memory, Input & Output

    - Input can come from anywhere......phones, sensors on cars, etc,....
    - When you input a number on a neyboard, it is converted into binary, it then figures out how to display the letter that you typed, and the output is when the letter appears on the screen. It happens incredibly fast.
    - The more complicated the output is, the more powerful a CPU must be, and the more memory is needed.

    ## Hardware & Software

    - Hardware is visible. 
    - Software is the code.
    - CPU
        - Links the hardware to the software.
        - A series of commands tell the hardware what to do.
        - Binary code controls all of the hardware.
        - High level code commands break it down to binary.
            - The Opearting System is the master code.
