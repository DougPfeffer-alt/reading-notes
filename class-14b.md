# [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

## New research reveals surprising truths about why some work groups thrive and others falter.

- Working in teams can produce a wide range of results. It's up to us how we approach the team, and we contribute.

- In 2015, Google launched Project Aristotle - to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. 

### Project Aristotle:

  - Reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked.
  - Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests?
  - Did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? 
  - How often did teammates socialize outside the office? 
  - Did they have the same hobbies? 
  - Were their educational backgrounds similar? 
  - Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? 
  - They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments’ goals. 
  - They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team’s success.
  - Results were inclusive:

    - Some groups that were ranked among Google’s most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work. 
    - Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room. 
    - Some groups sought strong managers. 
    - Others preferred a less hierarchical structure. 
    - Most confounding of all, two teams might have nearly identical makeups, with overlapping memberships, but radically different levels of effectiveness. 

### Group Norms

  - Research was noted by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as ‘‘group norms.’’ 

    - Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather:  

      - One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate 
      - Another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink. 
      - Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound. 
      - Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.

  - Project Aristotle’s researchers began searching through the data they had collected, looking for norms. They looked for instances when team members described a particular behavior as an ‘‘unwritten rule’’ or when they explained certain things as part of the ‘‘team’s culture.’’ 

    - Some groups said that teammates interrupted one another constantly and that team leaders reinforced that behavior by interrupting others themselves. 
    - On other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn. 
    - Some teams celebrated birthdays and began each meeting with informal chitchat about weekend plans. 
    - Other groups got right to business and discouraged gossip. - There were teams that contained outsize personalities who hewed to their group’s sedate norms, and others in which introverts came out of their shells as soon as meetings began.
    - But which Norms matter most?

      -Was it better to let everyone speak as much as they wanted, or should strong leaders end meandering debates
      - Was it more effective for people to openly disagree with one another, or should conflicts be played down? 

### Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College Test Case

- Researchers wanted to know if there is a collective I. Q. that emerges within a team that is distinct from the smarts of any single member.

- To accomplish this, the researchers recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation. 

  - One assignment, for instance, asked participants to brainstorm possible uses for a brick. 

    - Some teams came up with dozens of clever uses 
    - Others kept describing the same ideas in different words. 

  - Another had the groups plan a shopping trip and gave each teammate a different list of groceries. The only way to maximize the group’s score was for each person to sacrifice an item they really wanted for something the team needed. 

    - Some groups easily divvied up the buying 
    - Others couldn’t fill their shopping carts because no one was willing to compromise.

- What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright. But what was confusing was that not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways.

- As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. 

  - First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. 

  - Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people’s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in the experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.

  - In other words, if you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B. 

    - Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. But the group’s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid. There’s a good chance the members of Team A will continue to act like individuals once they come together, and there’s little to suggest that, as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.

    - In contrast, on Team B, people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one another’s moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts.

**For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.**

**What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.**

# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## Transforms

With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

The transform property comes in two different settings: 
- Two-dimensional
- Three-dimensional. 

Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

## 2D Transforms

### Transform Syntax
The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

### 2D Transforms

Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. 

### 2D Rotate

The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.

### 2D Scale

Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.

### 2D Translate
The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document. 

### 2D Skew

The last transform value in the group, skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. 

### Combining Transforms

It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once, rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time for example. In this event multiple transforms can be combined together. To combine transforms, list the transform values within the transform property one after the other without the use of commas.

### Transform Origin

As previously mentioned, the default transform origin is the dead center of an element, both 50% horizontally and 50% vertically. To change this default origin position the transform-origin property may be used.

The transform-origin property can accept one or two values. When only one value is specified, that value is used for both the horizontal and vertical axes. If two values are specified, the first is used for the horizontal axis and the second is used for the vertical axis.

Individually the values are treated like that of a background image position, using either a length or keyword value. That said, 0 0 is the same value as top left, and 100% 100% is the same value as bottom right. More specific values can also be set, for example 20px 50px would set the origin to 20 pixels across and 50 pixels down the element.

### Perspective

In order for three-dimensional transforms to work the elements need a perspective from which to transform. The perspective for each element can be thought of as a vanishing point, similar to that which can be seen in three-dimensional drawings.

### Perspective Depth Value

The perspective value can be set as none or a length measurement. The none value turns off any perspective, while the length value will set the depth of the perspective. The higher the value, the further away the perspective appears, thus creating a fairly low intensity perspective and a small three-dimensional change. The lower the value the closer the perspective appears, thus creating a high intensity perspective and a large three-dimensional change.

### Perspective Origin

As with setting a transform-origin you can also set a perspective-origin. The same values used for the transform-origin property may also be used with the perspective-origin property, and maintain the same relationship to the element. The large difference between the two falls where the origin of a transform determines the coordinates used to calculate the change of a transform, while the origin of a perspective identifies the coordinates of the vanishing point of a transform.

## 3D Transforms

Working with two-dimensional transforms we are able to alter elements on the horizontal and vertical axes, however there is another axis along which we can transform elements. Using three-dimensional transforms we can change elements on the z axis, giving us control of depth as well as length and width.

### 3D Rotate

So far we’ve discussed how to rotate an object either clockwise or counterclockwise on a flat plane. With three-dimensional transforms we can rotate an element around any axes. To do so, we use three new transform values, including rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ.

### 3D Scale

By using the scaleZ three-dimensional transform elements may be scaled on the z axis. This isn’t extremely exciting when no other three-dimensional transforms are in place, as there is nothing in particular to scale. In the demonstration below the elements are being scaled up and down on the z axis, however the rotateX value is added in order to see the behavior of the scaleZ value. When removing the rotateX in this case, the elements will appear to be unchanged.

### 3D Translate

Elements may also be translated on the z axis using the translateZ value. A negative value here will push an element further away on the z axis, resulting in a smaller element. Using a positive value will pull an element closer on the z axis, resulting in a larger element.

### 3D Skew

Skew is the one two-dimensional transform that cannot be transformed on a three-dimensional scale. Elements may be skewed on the x and y axis, then transformed three-dimensionally as wished, but they cannot be skewed on the z axis.

### Shorthand 3D Transforms

As with combining two-dimensional transforms, there are also properties to write out shorthand three-dimensional transforms. These properties include rotate3d, scale3d, transition3d, and matrix3d. 

### Transform Style

On occasion three-dimensional transforms will be applied on an element that is nested within a parent element which is also being transformed. In this event, the nested, transformed elements will not appear in their own three-dimensional space. To allow nested elements to transform in their own three-dimensional plane use the transform-style property with the preserve-3d value.

The transform-style property needs to be placed on the parent element, above any nested transforms. The preserve-3d value allows the transformed children elements to appear in their own three-dimensional plane while the flat value forces the transformed children elements to lie flat on the two-dimensional plane.

## Backface Visibility

When working with three-dimensional transforms, elements will occasionally be transformed in a way that causes them to face away from the screen. This may be caused by setting the rotateY(180deg) value for example. By default these elements are shown from the back. So if you prefer not to see these elements at all, set the backface-visibility property to hidden, and you will hide the element whenever it is facing away from the screen.

## Transitions & Animations

One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

For a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the following pseudo classes:
  - :hover
  - :focus
  - :active
  - :target

There are four transition related properties in total:
  - transition-property
  - transition-duration
  - transition-timing-function
  - transition-delay.

### Transitional Property

The transition-property property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties. By default, all of the properties within an element’s different states will be altered upon change. However, only the properties identified within the transition-property value will be affected by any transitions.

### Transition Duration

The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the transition-duration property. The value of this property can be set using general timing values, including seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). These timing values may also come in fractional measurements, .2s for example.

### Transition Delay

On top of declaring the transition property, duration, and timing function, you can also set a delay with the transition-delay property. The delay sets a time value, seconds or milliseconds, that determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing. As with all other transition properties, to delay numerous transitions, each delay can be declared as comma separated values.

## Animations

Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.

### Animations Keyframes

To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.
