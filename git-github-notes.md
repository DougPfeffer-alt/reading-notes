# Git Notes

## Before Git, dicuss Version Control

### Local Version Control

Many years ago, programmers created Local Version Control systems. A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

### Centralized Version Control

The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS).

### Distributed Version Control systems

A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions. Also, in the event of corruption of a central database’s hard disk — with the absence of backups — all work will be lost, except for any portions on local machines.

To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.

## What is Git

### Snapshot

Every time you commit changes, Git creates a snapshop, so that you cna easily get back to where you started.

### Local Operations

Operates on the local disc

### Tracking Changes

Tracks all changes made to projects as you commit

### Loss of Data

Keeps you from accidentilly losing your data

### 3 States

Committed - Data is securely stored in a local database

Modified - File has been changed but not committed to the database

Staged - Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot

_Downloading Git is pretty easy. It can be done throigh the Terminal, on the website, by downloading GitHub for Macs, or by downloading ZCode (New version out on July 7), which has it embedded. Easy to also check for its presence throught he Terminal.

## Setting up a Git repository cab done in two ways:

* Importing
* Cloning

## Workflow

### Local Repository Structure

The local Git repository has three components:

* Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
* Index: The area used for staging
* Head: Points to the most recent commit

### Saving Changes

* Tracked - Tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged; they were part of the most recent file snapshot.

* Untracked - Untracked files were not in the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area.

### The Lifecycle of File Status

1. After you edit a file, Git flags it as modified because of changes made after the previous commit.
1. You stage the modified file.
1. Then, you commit staged changes.
