# Comparison of basic text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE.

### Basic Text Editor

1. _Not Many Perks_ - A very basic tool, with no bells and whistles, designed to be functional, but not very user-friendly
2. _Pre-Loaded on the Machine_ - Whether you're operationg on a Mac, a Windows machine or Linux, a Basic Text Editor comes pre-loaded
3. _FREE_ - It is a FREE tool that comes with the machine

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

1. _Easy on the Eyes_ - A dark background, and colored text makes it easy on the eyes for hours of coding
2. _Useful tools_ - Additional tools such as code completion. , which will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed, as well as the closing 
oof tags when you open them, the closing of brackets when you open them, or the closing of quotation marks when you open them, makes writing code a lot more 
efficient.There is also a shorthand language called Emmet that speeds up your code writing . Another feature you should definitely look into is called syntax
highlighting. Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color 
than elements. And elements are a different colorthan copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it, as well as making 
your text easier to read.
3. _FREE?_ - Soem are free, and grrat options, but some do cost a bit
4. _Extensions_ - Some offer the opportunity to add extensions, making life even easier

*NOTES*: For me _VS Code_ seems like the eway to go. Easy to use, free, extensions, and industry acceptance are all reasons why I'm rolling with VS Code.
