# Growth Mindset

> Growth mindset to me means having a Learn and Grow approach to material. It's not being afraid to fail fast, and to learn from your mistakes. It encourages growth, trying new things...and learning, learning, learning.

1. Nothing is easy at first
2. Learn from failures
3. Fail fast is ok
