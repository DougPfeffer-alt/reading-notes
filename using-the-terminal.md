* Command Line or Terminal - Text-based interface with the system

* Opening a Terminal

*. On a MAC (me), got to Applications, Utilities then Terminal
*. On a LINUX Machine, go to Applications, System then Utilities

### Terminology

1. pwd - Print Working Directory - The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory is. It's easy to get lost in the sauce....this will remind you of where you're at.
2. ls - Short List
3. ls with [] - These items are optional
4. ls -l - Long List
5. Absolute Path - Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )
6. Relative Path - Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
7. ~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents
8. . (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory. eg in the example above we referred to Documents on line 4 with a relative path. It could also be written as ./Documents (Normally this extra bit is not required but in later sections we will see where it comes in handy).
9. .. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.
10. cd - Change Directory. The command cd may be run without a location as we saw in the shortcut above but usually will be run with a single command line argument which is the location we would like to change into. The location is specified as a path and as such may be specified as either an absolute or relative path
11. file - obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
12. ls -a - List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
13. Everything is a file under Linux. Even directories.
14. Linux is an extensionless system. Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
15. Linux is case sensitive. Beware of silly typos.
