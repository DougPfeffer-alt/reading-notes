## Website Structure (Chapter 1)

* HTML uses elements to describe the structure of the website. Like a recipe.
* Tags - What is within the tags is the purpose of the tag. Must close the tag with a forward slash.
* Attributes tell us more about the elements, such as the attributes name and it's value (in double quotes)
* Body - What appears in the main browser window.
* Head - The Heading.
* Title - Ttile of the page, or what will appear at the top of the browser, or tab page.  

## HTML5 (Chapter 17, 18)

* Traditional HTML layout versus new HTML5 layout - In the tarditional version, authors used div elements to identify parts of the lage. With HTML5, each part has it's own element, such as header, footer and nav. 
* Each webpage must begin with a DOCTYPE declaration of which HTML we're using. 
* Block Elements (h1, p, ul, li) will always start on a new line. 
* Inloine Elements (a, b, em, img) will always continue on the same line as neighboring elements. 
* A "div" element allows us to group everything together in one level box, like the title, header, etc,...
* A "span" element is the inline equivelant to the "div" element. 
* The "iframe" element is a window to another site. For this, you will need:
    * src (the URL to the other page) 
    * height
    * width
    * scrolling ability
    * a frame border
    * for it to be seamless
* The "meta" element contains info about your page
* Escape characters can allow you to use characters that would normally generate a reaction in HTML
