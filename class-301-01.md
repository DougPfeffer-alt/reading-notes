## Responsive Wed Design

With the growth in mobile Internet usage comes the question of how to build websites suitable for all users. The industry response to this question has become responsive web design, also known as RWD.

### Responsive Overview

Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.

### Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile

Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same. 

- Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change 
- while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. 
- Mobile, on the other hand, generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users. 

**Currently the most popular technique lies within responsive web design, favoring design that dynamically adapts to different browser and device viewports, changing layout and content along the way. This solution has the benefits of being all three, responsive, adaptive, and mobile.**

### Responsive web design is broken down into three main components:

- Flexible layouts (the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width)
- Media queries
- Flexible media. 

#### Felxible Layouts

**Flexible layouts do not advocate the use of fixed measurement units, such as pixels or inches. Reason being, the viewport height and width continually change from device to device. Website layouts need to adapt to this change and fixed values have too many constraints. Fortunately, Ethan pointed out an easy formula to help identify the proportions of a flexible layout using relative values.**

**The formula is based around taking the target width of an element and dividing it by the width of it’s parent element. The result is the relative width of the target element.**

**target ÷ context = result**

#### Media Queries

Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles. Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example.

##### Initializing Media Queries

There are a couple different ways to use media queries

- Using the `@media` rule inside of an existing style sheet
- Importing a new style sheet using the `@import` rule, or by linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document. 

**Generally speaking it is recommend to use the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet to avoid any additional HTTP requests.**

Each media query may include a media type followed by one or more expressions. Common media types include all:

- screen
- print
- tv
- braille

**One popular technique with using media queries is called mobile first. The mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.**

**The operating belief behind mobile first design is that a user on a mobile device, commonly using a smaller viewport, shouldn’t have to load the styles for a desktop computer only to have them over written with mobile styles later. Doing so is a waste of bandwidth. Bandwidth that is precious to any users looking for a snappy website.**

**The mobile first approach also advocates designing with the constraints of a mobile user in mind. Before too long, the majority of Internet consumption will be done on a mobile device. Plan for them accordingly and develop intrinsic mobile experiences.**

#### Flexible Media

The final, equally important aspect to responsive web design involves flexible media. As viewports begin to change size media doesn’t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.

##### Flexible Embedded Media

Unfortunately the max-width property doesn’t work well for all instances of media, specifically around iframes and embedded media. When it comes to third party websites, such as YouTube, who use iframes for embedded media this is a huge disappointment. Fortunately, there is a work around.

To get embedded media to be fully responsive, the embedded element needs to be absolutely positioned within a parent element. The parent element needs to have a width of 100% so that it may scale based on the width of the viewport. The parent element also needs to have a height of 0 to trigger the hasLayout mechanism within Internet Explorer.

Padding is then given to the bottom of the parent element, the value of which is set in the same aspect ratio of the video. This allows the height of the parent element to be proportionate to that of it’s width. Remember the responsive design formula from before? If a video has an aspect ratio of 16:9, 9 divided by 16 equals .5625, thus requiring a bottom padding of 56.25%. Padding on the bottom and not the top is specifically used to prevent Internet Explorer 5.5 from breaking, and treating the parent element as an absolutely positioned element.

# [All About Floats](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/)

## What is “Float?

Float is a CSS positioning property. To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. This is commonly and appropriately called “text wrap”.

In page layout programs, the boxes that hold the text can be told to honor the text wrap, or to ignore it. Ignoring the text wrap will allow the words to flow right over the image like it wasn’t even there. This is the difference between that image being part of the flow of the page (or not). Web design is very similar.

There are four valid values for the float property:

- Left and Right float elements those directions respectively
- None (the default) ensures the element will not float
- Inherit which will assume the float value from that elements parent element.

## Clearing the Float

Float’s sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float.

## The Great Collapse

One of the more bewildering things about working with floats is how they can affect the element that contains them (their “parent” element). If this parent element contained nothing but floated elements, the height of it would literally collapse to nothing. This isn’t always obvious if the parent doesn’t contain any visually noticeable background, but it is important to be aware of.

## Techniques for Clearing Floats

If you are in a situation where you always know what the succeeding element is going to be, you can apply the clear: both; value to that element and go about your business. This is ideal as it requires no fancy hacks and no additional elements making it perfectly semantic. Of course things don’t typically work out that way and we need to have more float-clearing tools in our toolbox.

- The Empty Div Method is, quite literally, an empty div. `<div style="clear: both;"></div>`. Sometimes you’ll see a`<br>` element or some other random element used, but div is the most common because it has no browser default styling, doesn’t have any special function, and is unlikely to be generically styled with CSS. 
- The Overflow Method relies on setting the overflow CSS property on a parent element. If this property is set to auto or hidden on the parent element, the parent will expand to contain the floats, effectively clearing it for succeeding elements. 
- The Easy Clearing Method uses a clever CSS pseudo selector (:after) to clear floats. 

## Problems with Floats

Floats often get beat on for being fragile. The majority of this fragility comes from IE 6 and the slew of float-related bugs it has. As more and more designers are dropping support for IE 6, you may not care, but for the folks that do care here is a quick rundown.

- Pushdown is a symptom of an element inside a floated item being wider than the float itself (typically an image). Most browsers will render the image outside the float, but not have the part sticking out affect other layout.
- Double Margin Bug – Another thing to remember when dealing with IE 6 is that if you apply a margin in the same direction as the float, it will double the margin. Quick fix: set display: inline on the float, and don’t worry it will remain a block-level element.
- The 3px Jog is when text that is up next to a floated element is mysteriously kicked away by 3px like a weird forcefield around the float. Quick fix: set a width or height on the affected text.
- In IE 7, the Bottom Margin Bug is when if a floated parent has floated children inside it, bottom margin on those children is ignored by the parent. Quick fix: using bottom padding on the parent instead.
