# Doug's Reading Notes

### Growth Mindset

> Growth mindset to me means having a Learn and Grow approach to material. It's not being afraid to fail fast, and to learn from your mistakes. It encourages growth, trying new things...and learning, learning, learning.

1. Nothing is easy at first
2. Learn from failures
3. Fail fast

Hi, my nanme is **Doug**, I'm a veteran of both the Army and the Navy. I spent 4 years in the Navy as a Search and Rescue Swimmer, and 20 years in the Army as a Forward Observer...retiring in 2013. Since then, I've served with three Nonprofits. In 2013, I launched the first ever one-stop-shop for Veterans Resources in Washington State - RallyPoint/6. In 2015, I accepted a role as an Executive Director with an Equine Therapy Facility serving veterans with PTSD and autistic children. And since 2016, I've served as the Executive Director for The Mission Continues, a national Veteran Service Organization.
