# Doug's Reading Notes

### Growth Mindset

> Growth mindset to me means having a Learn and Grow approach to material. It's not being afraid to fail fast, and to learn from your mistakes. It encourages growth, trying new things...and learning, learning, learning.

1. Nothing is easy at first
2. Learn from failures
3. Fail fast is ok

Hi, my name is **Doug**, I'm a veteran of both the Army and the Navy. I spent 4 years in the Navy as a Search and Rescue Swimmer, and 20 years in the Army as a Forward Observer...retiring in 2013. Since then, I've served with three Nonprofits. In 2013, I launched the first ever one-stop-shop for Veterans Resources in Washington State - RallyPoint/6. In 2015, I accepted a role as an Executive Director with an Equine Therapy Facility serving veterans with PTSD and autistic children. And since 2016, I've served as the Executive Director for The Mission Continues, a national Veteran Service Organization. And as I mentioned.....I'm a pretty serious :biking_man:

__Markdown Notes__

Markdown saves a ton of time. What, in HTML, might take 5 key strokes, would take far less time in Markdown. I can see it as an incredible tool for collaboration, and simplicity...but it does seem a little limited.

Mastering Markdown on Github covered the basics, as well as a ton of examples from very basic heading differences, down to emojis.....great resource.

Github pages gave a great overview....and introduction to Github, and basically outlined it's uses, and why it's a great tool for developers.

Github markdown syntax was another great resource (bookmark), providing a go to option for a ton of great ways to input on the site.

***Key Takeaways***

1. Easy to collaboratively edit pages
2. You can format text, and take advantage of the automation of the site
3. Having a couple of key pages to bookmark makes a lot of sense
4. Super easy
5. Good tool....will need to bookmark all additonal resources, beacuse there is a ton that you can do

# Comparison of basic text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE.

### Basic Text Editor

1. _Not Many Perks_ - A very basic tool, with no bells and whistles, designed to be functional, but not very user-friendly
2. _Pre-Loaded on the Machine_ - Whether you're operationg on a Mac, a Windows machine or Linux, a Basic Text Editor comes pre-loaded
3. _FREE_ - It is a FREE tool that comes with the machine

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

1. _Easy on the Eyes_ - A dark background, and colored text makes it easy on the eyes for hours of coding
2. _Useful tools_ - Additional tools such as code completion. , which will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed, as well as the closing 
oof tags when you open them, the closing of brackets when you open them, or the closing of quotation marks when you open them, makes writing code a lot more 
efficient.There is also a shorthand language called Emmet that speeds up your code writing . Another feature you should definitely look into is called syntax
highlighting. Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color 
than elements. And elements are a different colorthan copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it, as well as making 
your text easier to read.
3. _FREE?_ - Soem are free, and grrat options, but some do cost a bit
4. _Extensions_ - Some offer the opportunity to add extensions, making life even easier

*NOTES*: For me _VS Code_ seems like the eway to go. Easy to use, free, extensions, and industry acceptance are all reasons why I'm rolling with VS Code.

## Basic Terminal Usage Cheat Sheet

* Command Line or Terminal - Text-based interface with the system

* Opening a Terminal

*. On a MAC (me), got to Applications, Utilities then Terminal
*. On a LINUX Machine, go to Applications, System then Utilities

### Terminology

1. pwd - Print Working Directory - The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory is. It's easy to get lost in the sauce....this will remind you of where you're at.
2. ls - Short List
3. ls with [] - These items are optional
4. ls -l - Long List
5. Absolute Path - Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )
6. Relative Path - Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
7. ~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents
8. . (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory. eg in the example above we referred to Documents on line 4 with a relative path. It could also be written as ./Documents (Normally this extra bit is not required but in later sections we will see where it comes in handy).
9. .. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.
10. cd - Change Directory. The command cd may be run without a location as we saw in the shortcut above but usually will be run with a single command line argument which is the location we would like to change into. The location is specified as a path and as such may be specified as either an absolute or relative path
11. file - obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
12. ls -a - List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
13. Everything is a file under Linux. Even directories.
14. Linux is an extensionless system. Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
15. Linux is case sensitive. Beware of silly typos.
