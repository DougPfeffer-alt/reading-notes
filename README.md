# Doug's Reading Notes

Hi, my name is **Doug**, I'm a veteran of both the Army and the Navy. I spent 4 years in the Navy as a Search and Rescue Swimmer, and 20 years in the Army as a Forward Observer...retiring in 2013. 

Since then, I've served with three Nonprofits. In 2013, I launched the first ever one-stop-shop for Veterans Resources in Washington State - RallyPoint/6. In 2015, I accepted a role as an Executive Director with an Equine Therapy Facility serving veterans with PTSD and autistic children. And since 2016, I've served as the Executive Director for The Mission Continues, a national Veteran Service Organization. And as I mentioned in class.....I'm a pretty serious cyclist.

This website is a compilation of my Reading Notes from my Code Fellows Classes; 101, 102, 201, 301 and 401.

I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougpfeffer/)
