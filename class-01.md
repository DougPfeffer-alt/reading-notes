## Website Structure (Chapter 1)

* HTML uses elements to describe the structure of the website. Like a recipe.
* Tags - What is within the tags is the purpose of the tag. Must close the tag with a forward slash.
* Attributes tell us more about the elements, such as the attributes name and it's value (in double quotes)
* Body - What appears in the main browser window.
* Head - The Heading.
* Title - Ttile of the page, or what will appear at the top of the browser, or tab page.  

## Extra Markup (Chapter 8)

The evolution of HTML 

1. HTML 4 - 1997
1. XHTML - 2000
1. HTML5 - Work in progress

- DOCTYPES indicate which verion of HTML we're working in.
- Comments in HTML are written like so `<!-- -->`
- ID Attribute: Allows you to give every elemnt a unique identifier, so that you can style it separately from others in CSS.
- Class Attributes: Instead of identifying one unique element, class attributes enable you to group several together, so that you can style several at a time in CSS.
- Block Elelements: Elemenst that always start on a new line.
- Inline Elements: Elements that appear to continue on the same line.
- Grouping texts and elements in a block: Using the `<div>` element, you can group several elements together in one block-level box.
- Grouping texts and elements inline: Using the `<span>` element, is basically using the inline version of the `<div>` element.
- An `<iframe>` is a window to another page that sits on your page.....like a google map.
- `<meta>` sits inside the `<head>` portion if the page, and contains information about your page:
    - Description
    - Keyqords
    - Robots
    - Author
    - Pragma
    - Expires
- Escape Characters (p.193)

## HTML5 Layout (Chapter 17)

- A `<header>` and `<footer>` appear at the top and the bottom of each page.
- A `<nav>` element contains major navigational blocks for the primary site.
- An `<article>` element is like a container for a section of a page that needs to stand alone.
-`<aside>` element
    - If used inside an article, it contains information reference the article.
    - If used outside the article, it contains info for the entire page.
- A `<section>` element groups related content together. Typically, each section will have it's own header.
- A Heading Group `<hgroup>` groups together a set of one or more `<h1>` through `<h6>` elements so that they all appear under the same heading.
- Figures `<figure>` or `<figcation>` is used to reference content from the main flow of the article.
- Sectioning Elements `<div>` Where there is no suitable element to group a set, the `<div>` element is used.

## Process & Design (Chapter 18)

### When building a website, we should take some things into consideration

1. Who is the site for? - Identifying your target audience.
1. Why people visit your website? - Why are they on your site? 
1. What your visitors are trying to achieve? - What's their goal? 
1. What information your visitors need? - What info will they need?
1. How often they visit your website? - Frequency?
1. Site Maps - A road map for the sire.
1. Wireframes - A visual layout of the sire prior to buildout.

## The ABC of Programming (Chapter 1)

### What is a script and how do I create one?

- A script is a series of instructions, like a manual, a recipe or a handbook.
- Writing a script 
    - State your goals
        1. Define the goal 
        1. Design the script 
        1. Code each step 
    - Write a series of tasks required to meet that goal.
        - Step by step instructions...... 
        - It helps to sketch this out in a flowchart. 

### How do computers fit in with the world around them?

- Computers create models of the world using data. Computers do not inherently know what's around them, we have to build it all as an object. An object can have its own:
    - Properties (Characteristics)
    - Events (Ways to interact with objects)
    - Methods (Things that we do with objects)
        * Together, they create a working model of an object. 
- Web Brpwsers are programs built with objects
- The document object represents the HTML page. The
- How a browser sees a webpage:
    1. Receive a page as HTML code 
    1. Create a model of the page and store it in its memory.
    1. Use a rendering engine to show the page on the screen. 

### How do I write a script for a webpage?

- How does it fit together?
    - HTML: Content Layer
    - CSS: Presentation Layer
    - JavaScript: Behavior Layer

### Other Notes
