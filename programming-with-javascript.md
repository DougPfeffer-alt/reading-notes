## The ABCs of Programming

### What is a script and how do I create one?

- A script is a series of instructions, like a manual, a recipe or a handbook.
- Writing a script 
    - State your goals
        1. Define the goal 
        1. Design the script 
        1. Code each step 
    - Write a series of tasks required to meet that goal.
        - Step by step instructions...... 
        - It helps to sketch this out in a flowchart. 

## Expressions

- 2 Types of Expressions: 
    Expressions that just assign a value to a variable. 
    Expressions that use 2 or more values to return a single value. 
- Expressions rely on operators.
    - Assignment Operators (color = 'beige';)
    - Arithmetic Operators (area = 3 * 2;)
    - String Operators (greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly';)
    - Comparison Operators (buy = 3 > 5;)
    - Logical Operators (buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);)
- When using Arithmetic Operators, it is important to understand that multiplications and divisions will be executed prior to additions and subtractions.
- There is only one String Operator, the + Symbol.
- When using String Elements, you must place a space after each element to account for the space displayed during output.

## What is a Function?

- A function is a series of statements that are grouped together to perform a specific task.
- Function Declaration
    - Giving it a name and writing the statements needed to achieve the task in curly braces.
- Calling the Function
    - Having declared the function, you can now execute  what's within the curly braces with just one line of code.....this is calling the function.
- When declaring functions require specific info, you assign it parameters.  
- When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the value . The values are called arguments, and they can be provided as values or variables.
