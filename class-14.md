# [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

## New research reveals surprising truths about why some work groups thrive and others falter.

- Working in teams can produce a wide range of results. It's up to us how we approach the team, and we contribute.

- In 2015, Google launched Project Aristotle - to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. 

### Project Aristotle:

  - Reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked.
  - Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests?
  - Did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? 
  - How often did teammates socialize outside the office? 
  - Did they have the same hobbies? 
  - Were their educational backgrounds similar? 
  - Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? 
  - They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments’ goals. 
  - They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team’s success.
  - Results were inclusive:

    - Some groups that were ranked among Google’s most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work. 
    - Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room. 
    - Some groups sought strong managers. 
    - Others preferred a less hierarchical structure. 
    - Most confounding of all, two teams might have nearly identical makeups, with overlapping memberships, but radically different levels of effectiveness. 

### Group Norms

  - Research was noted by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as ‘‘group norms.’’ 

    - Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather:  

      - One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate 
      - Another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink. 
      - Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound. 
      - Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.

  - Project Aristotle’s researchers began searching through the data they had collected, looking for norms. They looked for instances when team members described a particular behavior as an ‘‘unwritten rule’’ or when they explained certain things as part of the ‘‘team’s culture.’’ 

    - Some groups said that teammates interrupted one another constantly and that team leaders reinforced that behavior by interrupting others themselves. 
    - On other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn. 
    - Some teams celebrated birthdays and began each meeting with informal chitchat about weekend plans. 
    - Other groups got right to business and discouraged gossip. - There were teams that contained outsize personalities who hewed to their group’s sedate norms, and others in which introverts came out of their shells as soon as meetings began.
    - But which Norms matter most?

      -Was it better to let everyone speak as much as they wanted, or should strong leaders end meandering debates
      - Was it more effective for people to openly disagree with one another, or should conflicts be played down? 

### Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College Test Case

- Researchers wanted to know if there is a collective I. Q. that emerges within a team that is distinct from the smarts of any single member.

- To accomplish this, the researchers recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation. 

  - One assignment, for instance, asked participants to brainstorm possible uses for a brick. 

    - Some teams came up with dozens of clever uses 
    - Others kept describing the same ideas in different words. 

  - Another had the groups plan a shopping trip and gave each teammate a different list of groceries. The only way to maximize the group’s score was for each person to sacrifice an item they really wanted for something the team needed. 

    - Some groups easily divvied up the buying 
    - Others couldn’t fill their shopping carts because no one was willing to compromise.

- What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright. But what was confusing was that not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways.

- As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. 

  - First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. 

  - Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people’s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in the experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.

  - In other words, if you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B. 

    - Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. But the group’s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid. There’s a good chance the members of Team A will continue to act like individuals once they come together, and there’s little to suggest that, as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.

    - In contrast, on Team B, people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one another’s moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts.

**For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.**

**What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.**
