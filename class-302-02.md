# Read: 02 - jQuery, Events, and The DOM

## jQuery (JS - pp.293-301, 306-331, 354-357)

### What is jQuery?

jQuery is a JavaScript file that you include in your web pages. It lets you find elemenst using CSS-Style Selectors and then do something with the elements using jQuery methods.

- Find elements using CSS-Style selectors
- Do something with the elemenst using jQuery methods

**In order to use jQuery, you must include the jQuery script on the main page before the closing `<body>` tag. Once jQuery has been added to the page, a secong JS file is included that uses jQuery selectors and methods to update the content of the HTML page.**

Why use jQuery?

JQuery doesn't do anything that you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file, but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.

### Doing things with your selection

#### A matched set/jQuery selection

When you select one or more elements, a jQuery object is returned. It is also known as a matched set or a jQuery selection.

#### JQuesry methods that get and set data

Some jQuery methods both retrieve information from, and update the contents of, elements. But thyey do not always apply to all elements.

#### JQuery objects store references to elements

When you create a selection with jQuery, it stores a reference to the corresponding nodes in the DOM tree. It does not create copies of them.

#### Caching jQuery selections in variables

A jQuery object stores references to elements. Caching a jQuery object stores a reference to it in a variable. 

#### Looping

In plain JS, you would need to write code to loop throigh all of the elemenst selected. In jQuery, a selector returns multiple elements. 

#### Chaining

If you wanted to use more than one jQuery method, you can just have them seperated by a dot. 

#### Checking if a page is ready to work with

JQuery's .ready() method checks if a page is ready to work with. 

#### Getting element content

The .html() and .text() mthods both retrieve and update the content of elements. 

- When the .html() mthod is used to retrive information from a jQuery selection, it retrieves only the html inside the first element in the matched set, along with any of its descendants.
- The .text() method is used to retrieve the etxt from a jQuery selection, it returns the content from every element in the jQuery selection, along with the text from any descendants.

#### Updating elements

Four methods that update the content of all elements in a jQuery selection:

- .html()
- .text()
- .replaceWith()
- .remove()

#### Inserting elements

Inserting new elements involves two steps:

- Create the new elements in a jQuery object
- Use a method to insert the content into a page

#### Getting and setting attribute values

You can create attributes, or access and update their content, using four methods:

- .attr()
- .removeAttr()
- .addClass()
- .removeClass()

#### Getting a setting CSS priorities

The .css() method lets you retrieve and set the values of css properties.

#### Working with each element in a selection

JQuery allows you to recreate the functionality of a loop on a selection of elements, using the .each() method.

#### Event methods

The .on() method is used to handle all events. Behind the scenes, jQuery handles all of the cross-browser issues that could occur.

#### The Event Object

Every event handling function receives an event object. It has methods and properties related to the event that ocurred.

#### Additonal parameters for event handlers

The .on() method has two optional properties that let you: 

- Filetr the intial jQuery selection to respond to a subset of the elements.
- Pass extra information into the event handler using object literal notation. 

#### Ways to inclue jQuery in your page

Before the closing `</body>` tag is the best way. In the head and in the page will only slow it down.
